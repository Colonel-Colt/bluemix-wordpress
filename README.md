WordPress on Bluemix
================================================================================

WordPress is an open source content management system (CMS) that is popular with 
both businesses and bloggers. WordPress is extendable and customizable through 
themes, plugins, and templates that make it easy to transform the site to meet 
your exact needs.

WordPress on Bluemix uses [Composer package manager](https://getcomposer.org) to install the 
[wordpress package from johnpbloch](https://packagist.org/packages/johnpbloch/wordpress) 
and configures the installation to use ClearDB (MySQL) for data, IBM Object Storage 
for media, and SendGrid for email.

Note: Only one instance of the SendGrid service is allowed per space. If your 
target space already has one, please either
* Rename your SendGrid instance to "mySendGrid" before deploying; or
* Fork this project and, in manifest.yml under services, change all instances of 
"mySendGrid" to match the name of your service instance.

# Configure Your Site
1.  After your application starts, go to it atÂ http://&lt;your-hostname&gt;.mybluemix.net.
2.  Follow the steps to configure your WordPress website for the first time.

## Configure SendGrid
The SendGrid plugin is enabled by default in WordPress on Bluemix.
To configure it, log in to your WordPress dashboard and select Settings > SendGrid.

Your credentials should be auto-completed from the environment variables passed to
your application from Bluemix, but under mail settings you should configure at 
least the following:
1.  Name: The name that you want the email to be from.
2.  Sending Address: The address that the email appears to originate from.
3.  Reply Address: The email that replies are sent to. Choose a working, existing email that you use.
4.  Categories: Any categories that you want to attach to your messages.

## Activate the WP Super Cache Plugin
1.  Navigate to the plugins page in the admin dashboard.
2.  Find the WP Super Cache plugin in the list and click Activate
3.  A message at the top of the page says, "WP Super Cache is disabled. Please go to the plugin admin page to enable caching." Click on the plugin admin page.
    * If you are directed to a page that says, "Permalink Structure Error", a custom URL or permalink structure is required for the plugin to work correctly. Go to the Permalinks Options Page to configure the permalinks. Click the Permalinks Options Page link and choose a new permalink structure. Hit Save Changes. A common choice here is month and name.
4.  Navigate to the WP Super Cache settings under the Settings Tab. Turn caching on. Hit Update Status.
You are now using caching.

## Customize Your WordPress
WordPress on Bluemix uses the [Composer package manager](https://getcomposer.org) 
for both the installation of the WordPress core and also for the installation of all 
plugins and themes.

Applications on Bluemix have an ephemeral filesystem, meaning that each time your 
application is restaged, the container that stores the files is destroyed and 
recreated from the application package. Therefore, WordPress on Bluemix disables 
in-place upgrades and warns against the web-based installation of plugins and themes.

Instead, to edit your installation, you must modify the composer.json file and re-push 
the application to Bluemix.
1.  Git clone your project repo or edit your application using Bluemix DevOps Services
2.  Modify composer.json with the set of plugins and themese you wish to install
3.  Push your changes to Bluemix using Bluemix DevOps Services or the cf cli
    *  For more info on the Cloud Foundry command-line interface, see 
[Start coding with Cloud Foundry command line interface](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/install_cli.html)

--Note: The default composer config from this repository will install the latest 
WordPress package each time the application is staged. If you would like to avoid 
unexpected upgrades, please change the following line in composer.json 
in order to lock into a specific version or version range:--
Note: The default composer config from this repository will install version 4.3.* 
of WordPress. If you would like to use any other verions, please change the 
following line in composer.json:

```
"johnpbloch/wordpress"                        : "4.3.*",
```

After each update to WordPress core, you may need to apply the changes to the database. 
WordPress should detect this and prompt you to run the database update from the 
WordPress dashboard (https://<your-site>/wp-login.php).

# FAQ
## What plugins are installed by default?
*   Disable Updates Manager: As Bluemix does not use a persistent file system, using the automatic update buttons in the WordPress UI would cause updates and plugins that you install to disappear after your app restarts. The Disable Updates Manager hides the update notifications for WordPress Core, plugins, and themes by default. You are welcome to change this setting, but keep in mind that all updates to your WordPress installation are handled by downloading your code and pushing again with the cf command.
*   Object Storage: Handles all media uploads for your WordPress site.
*   SendGrid: SendGrid provides email integration with your website. Activate the SendGrid Bluemix plugin to automatically use Bluemix credentials to use SendGrid, or provide your own.
*   WP Super Cache: A popular WordPress optimization plugin that uses caching to speed up your blog.

## What is IBM Object Storage and what is it being used for?
IBM Object Storage is a service that exposes OpenStack Swift APIs for storing "objects" like files.

IBM Object Storage is useful because WordPress traditionally relies on the local file 
system for things like media uploads. Bluemix, like other cloud platform, recycles 
the application container each time the application is staged. This action would 
result in losing your media files every time that you push or restart your Bluemix app. 
With IBM Object Storage, files are uploaded to the service so that they are never 
lost. The SoftLayer Swift plugin within WordPress provides an admin settings page so that you can 
manage your containers and your upload options.

## What is SendGrid and what is it being used for?
SendGrid is an easy to use email service that is integrated into WordPress on Bluemix. Using the SendGrid service enables your WordPress website to send emails for things like forgotten passwords or comment notifications. With Wordpress on Bluemix, everything's configured to work out of the box with no tedious work to setup email server configurations.

## My WordPress site received an "Error establishing a database connection" message.
You probably have too many concurrent users who are trying to access your website. By default, WordPress on Bluemix uses the free tier of ClearDB's MySQL database as a service that is suitable for trial usage. However, for real usage, consider upgrading to one of their paid tiers, which provide you with more simultaneous connections and more storage space. Unfortunately, paid tiers for ClearDB are not offered in Bluemix currently. Contact ClearDB support for options on upgrading your plan. You can also try activating the [WP Super Cache Plugin](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/wordpress/index.html#faq__WPSuperCache) to improve performance.

## My site is loading slowly. Can I speed it up?
Bluemix provides built-in support for scaling your apps. Increase the number of instances from 1 to however many needed (start with 2) until response times improve. You can also try activating the [WP Super Cache Plugin](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/wordpress/index.html#faq__WPSuperCache) to improve performance.

## I received an HTTP error when I tried to upload an image.
Either the IBM Object Storage service is down, or SoftLayer itself is down. If you provisioned your WordPress application, it's possible that your SoftLayer account is not created yet. Usually this problem resolves itself within several minutes.

## Using Composer to manage your WordPress application.
WordPress on Bluemix uses the PHP dependency manager Composer to dynamically install your plugins and themes. You can manage all plugins, even the WordPress core version, by modifying the composer.json file.
*   Open the composer.json file. Under the required section, you enter the information for what is being added. There is a specific composer vendor, wpackagist, that mirrors WordPress' SVN repositories for both plugins and themes. This creates a simple way to add more plugins and themes.
    *   If you want to specify a version of WordPress, you can change the following line: "johnpbloch/wordpress" : "*". The "*" can be replaced with your desired version number. For more information about the version notation, see [package versions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#package-versions "(Opens in a new tab or window)").
    *   If you are adding a plugin, the vendor name is wpackagist-plugin. The package name is whatever the plugin developer registered their plugin as. If you want to install a plugin that is called hello-world, then add wpackagist-plugin/hello-world in the require section.
    *   Adding a theme follows a similar model, but the vendor name is wpackagist-theme
    *   After that, specify a version number. You can use * to grab the most up-to-date version of a plugin. For themes, use the * in all cases.
    Example:
    `"wpackagist-plugin/hello-world"			: "*"
    "wpackagist-theme/twentytwelve			: "*"`
    For more information on packages and themes, see [WordPress Packagist](http://wpackagist.org/ "(Opens in a new tab or window)").
*   After you add plugins and themes, run composer update in a terminal that is in the same directory as your composer.json file. This action generates the composer.lock file that the buildpack uses to install everything, and also downloads the files that are specified in composer. Because they are downloaded again when you push, you should either add these folders to your .cfignore file, or delete them before you push.
*   Do a cf push. When the app is pushed, the buildpack uses the composer.lock file to download all of the files you've specified. They are then available to you in WordPress.
*   If you want to lock version numbers instead of always getting the latest, you can specify all version numbers in the composer.json file. Otherwise, you can install composer and run composer locally to generate a composer.lock file before pushing.

## Incorporating Private Plugins with Composer
Private and premium Wordpress plugins can be challenging to incorporate in this code repository.  Unlike public themes and plugins which can be obtained via wpackagist or another publically accessible git repository, private plugins usually need to be present as a local asset.  To leverage private plugins, you will need to do the following 3 steps:
1. Download and extract your Private Wordpress Plugin(s) into separate subfolder(s) under the parent folder named **lib** which is located at the root of this repository.  The parent folder name must remain as **lib** to ensure that the PHP CloudFoundry buildpack leaves the contents alone.
2. For each private plugin, add a composer.json file to the root of the folder with something similar to the following:

   ```
{
  	"name": "thethemefoundry/make-plus",
  	"type": "wordpress-plugin",
  	"keywords": ["wordpress", "plugin"],
  	"license": "This software is NOT to be distributed, but can be INCLUDED in WP themes: Premium or Contracted.",
  	"require": {
    	"php": ">=5.3.2",
    	"composer/installers": "v1.0.7"
  	}
} ```
3. Finally, we need to tell composer where to place this privately sourced plugin folder.  Modify this projects composer.json within the post-install-cmd array to include a command for **moving** your private plugin content to the wp-content plugins folder.  The command will look similar to this:

   ```"mv lib/my-personal-plugin-folder htdocs/wp-content/plugins"```    

## Routes to my posts and pages start failing unexpectedly
The .htaccess is a distributed config file.  Wordpress uses this file to manipulate how Apache serves files from its root directory and subdirectories thereof.  Most notably, WP modifies this file to be able to handle pretty permalinks. An example of a default version can be found [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/htaccess) . If your routes unexpectedly stop working until you reset your permalinks settings within the Admin dashboard, then you are most likely dealing with a .htaccess file that is either corrupt or being deleted after app restart.  Use the **cf files** or the Bluemix dashboard to inspect the .htaccess file which should be present at */app/htdocs/.htaccess*.  Visit the **lib** folder of this repository and update the .htaccess default file provided in this repo.  

## Object Storage HTTP Error: A field name was provided without a field value
Clicking the `Deploy to Bluemix` button creates an Object Storage subaccount for the application to use. This process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. This is the error that you see when it is not completed before you go to the Object Storage settings of your site. Try again in a minute and it might be working properly. If you are seeing this error and it is not the first time you've started the app, it might mean that the IBM Object Storage service is down.

## Can I upload files larger than 500 MB?
This value, along with several others, is defined in the .user.ini file in the root directory. You can change the value to anything you like, but keep in mind that the default disk quota in a Bluemix app is 1 GB, and it can be a maximum of 2 GB.
